1.	Location
2.	Suburb’s track record
3.	School zones
4.	Access to public transport
5.	Demographics
Demographics should also be taken into account including the median age, average income and the total population so you know who will likely be your target market of renters. If the suburb’s median age is old but the population and the average income is increasing, this can be an indication that the suburb is growing.  
6.	The economy
Things like unemployment, wages, population growth and the Aussie dollar all affect how much money everyone has and consequently, how many people can afford to buy a home.
7.	Demand and market performance
